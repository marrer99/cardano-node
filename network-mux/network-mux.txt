-- | This module allows the management of a multiple Async jobs which are
--   grouped by an 'Ord group =&gt; group' type.
module Control.Concurrent.JobPool

-- | JobPool allows to submit asynchronous jobs, wait for their completion
--   or cancel. Jobs are grouped, each group can be cancelled separately.
data JobPool group m a

-- | An asynchronous job which belongs to some group and its exception
--   handler.
data Job group m a

-- | An extension of <a>Channel</a>, with additional <a>Channel</a>
--   implementations.
module Network.Mux.Channel

-- | A channel which can send and receive values.
--   
--   It is more general than what `network-mux` requires, see
--   <a>ByteChannel</a> instead. However this is useful for testing
--   purposes when one is either using <tt>mux</tt> or connecting two ends
--   directly.
data Channel m a
Channel :: (a -> m ()) -> m (Maybe a) -> Channel m a

-- | Write bytes to the channel.
--   
--   It maybe raise exceptions.
[send] :: Channel m a -> a -> m ()

-- | Read some input from the channel, or <tt>Nothing</tt> to indicate EOF.
--   
--   Note that having received EOF it is still possible to send. The EOF
--   condition is however monotonic.
--   
--   It may raise exceptions (as appropriate for the monad and kind of
--   channel).
[recv] :: Channel m a -> m (Maybe a)

-- | Given an isomorphism between <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> (in Kleisli
--   category), transform a <tt><a>Channel</a> m a</tt> into
--   <tt><a>Channel</a> m b</tt>.

hoistChannel :: (forall x. m x -> n x) -> Channel m a -> Channel n a
channelEffect :: forall m a. Monad m => (a -> m ()) -> (Maybe a -> m ()) -> Channel m a -> Channel m a

-- | Delay a channel on the receiver end.
--   
--   This is intended for testing, as a crude approximation of network
--   delays. More accurate models along these lines are of course possible.
delayChannel :: MonadDelay m => DiffTime -> Channel m a -> Channel m a

-- | Channel which logs sent and received messages.
loggingChannel :: (MonadSay m, Show id, Show a) => id -> Channel m a -> Channel m a

-- | Make a <a>Channel</a> from a pair of <a>TMVar</a>s, one for reading
--   and one for writing.
mvarsAsChannel :: MonadSTM m => StrictTMVar m a -> StrictTMVar m a -> Channel m a

-- | Create a pair of channels that are connected via one-place buffers.
--   
--   This is primarily useful for testing protocols.
createConnectedChannels :: MonadSTM m => m (Channel m a, Channel m a)

-- | Channel using <a>ByteString</a>.
type ByteChannel m = Channel m ByteString

-- | Make a <a>Channel</a> from a pair of IO <tt>Handle</tt>s, one for
--   reading and one for writing.
--   
--   The Handles should be open in the appropriate read or write mode, and
--   in binary mode. Writes are flushed after each write, so it is safe to
--   use a buffering mode.
--   
--   For bidirectional handles it is safe to pass the same handle for both.
handlesAsChannel :: Handle -> Handle -> Channel IO ByteString

-- | Open a pair of Unix FIFOs, and expose that as a <a>Channel</a>.
--   
--   The peer process needs to open the same files but the other way
--   around, for writing and reading.
--   
--   This is primarily for the purpose of demonstrations that use
--   communication between multiple local processes. It is Unix specific.
withFifosAsChannel :: FilePath -> FilePath -> (ByteChannel IO -> IO a) -> IO a

-- | Make a <a>Channel</a> from a <tt>Socket</tt>. The socket must be a
--   stream socket
socketAsChannel :: Socket -> ByteChannel IO

-- | Create a pair of <a>Channel</a>s that are connected internally.
--   
--   This is intended for inter-thread communication, such as between a
--   multiplexing thread and a thread running a peer.
--   
--   It uses lazy <tt>ByteString</tt>s but it ensures that data written to
--   the channel is <i>fully evaluated</i> first. This ensures that any
--   work to serialise the data takes place on the <i>writer side and not
--   the reader side</i>.
createBufferConnectedChannels :: forall m. MonadSTM m => m (ByteChannel m, ByteChannel m)

-- | Create a local pipe, with both ends in this process, and expose that
--   as a pair of <a>Channel</a>s, one for each end.
--   
--   This is primarily for testing purposes since it does not allow actual
--   IPC.

withTimeoutSerial :: forall m b. (MonadAsync m, MonadFork m, MonadMonotonicTime m, MonadTimer m, MonadMask m, MonadThrow (STM m)) => (TimeoutFn m -> m b) -> m b

-- | An alternative implementation of <a>timeout</a> for platforms where
--   the standard implementation is too expensive.
--

--     -- now use timeout as one would use System.Timeout.timeout

--   
--   This implementation has a serial constraint: the body action that
--   calls <tt>timeout</tt> can <i>only do so from one thread at once</i>.
--   
--   Further details for the curious:
--   
--   the problem with <tt>System.Timeout.timeout</tt> is that (as of base
--   4.12) it has two implementations, one for Unix with the threaded RTS,
--   and one for all other configurations.
--   
--   The Unix threaded RTS implementation is rather clever and very fast.
--   In the normal case of no timeout, it only has to allocate a timer
--   entry. Only in the case the timeout occurs does it allocate a
--   <a>forkIO</a> thread to do the potentially-blocking operation of
--   sending the asynchronous exception to interrupt the action under
--   timeout.
--   
--   The implementation for all other configurations has to allocate a
--   <a>forkIO</a> thread up front, whether or not the timeout fires. This
--   is fine for many applications but not for network timers which have to
--   be created and altered/cancelled with very high frequency.
--   
--   The implementation here only relies upon <tt>threadDelay</tt> which
--   has an efficient implementation on all platforms. It uses a separate
--   monitoring thread which will throw an exception to terminate the
--   action if the timeout expires. This is why it uses the "with" style:
--   because it keeps a monitoring thread over a region of execution that
--   may use many timeouts. The cost of allocating this thread is amortised
--   over all the timeouts used.
--   
--   This implementation is simplified by the constraint that the timeouts
--   only be used serially. In addition, it has the limitation that
--   timeouts may not always be detected promptly: e.g. a 10s timeout on an
--   action that finishes immediately, followed by a 5s timeout on an
--   action will only actually be interrupted after 10s. So it's possible
--   that action with the 5s timeout runs for up to 10s. This is ok for
--   many applications provided that the variance in timeouts is not too
--   large and the timeouts don't need to be too tight.

--   <b>Isometric flow control: analysis of head-of-line blocking of the
--   ingress side of the multiplexer</b>
--   
--   For each mini-protocol (enumerated by <tt>ptcl</tt>), mux will create
--   two channels. One for initiator and one for the responder. Each
--   channel will use a single <a>Wanton</a>. When it is filled, it is put
--   in a common queue <tt>tsrQueue</tt>. This means that the queue is
--   bound by <tt>2 * |ptcl|</tt>. Every side of a mini-protocol is served
--   by a single <a>Wanton</a>: when an application sends data, the channel
--   will try to put it into the <a>Wanton</a> (which might block).
--   <a>Wanton</a>s are taken from the <tt>tsrQueue</tt> queue by one of
--   mux threads. This eliminates head of line blocking: each mini-protocol
--   thread can block on putting more bytes into its <a>Wanton</a>, but it
--   cannot block the other mini-protocols or the thread that is reading
--   the <tt>tsrQueue</tt> queue. This is ensured since the
--   <a>muxChannel</a> will put only a non-empty <a>Wanton</a> to the
--   <tt>tsrQueue</tt> queue, and on such wantons the queue is never
--   blocked. This means that the only way the queue can block is when its
--   empty, which means that none of the mini-protocols wanted to send. The
--   egress part will read a <a>Wanton</a>, take a fixed amount of bytes
--   encode them in as an <tt>MuxSDU</tt>; if there are leftovers it will
--   put them back in the <a>Wanton</a> and place it at the end of the
--   queue (reading and writing to it will happen in a single STM
--   transaction which assures that the order of requests from a
--   mini-protocol is preserved.
--   
--   Properties:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>at any given time the <tt>tsrQueue</tt> contains at most one
--   <a>TranslocationServiceRequest</a> from a given mini-protocol of the
--   given <a>MiniProtocolDir</a>, thus the queue contains at most <tt>2 *
--   |ptcl|</tt> translocation requests.</li>

stop :: MonadSTM m => Mux mode m -> m ()

-- | Arrange to run a protocol thread (for a particular
--   <a>MiniProtocolNum</a> and <a>MiniProtocolDirection</a>) to interact
--   on this protocol's <a>Channel</a>.
--   
--   The protocol thread can either be started eagerly or on-demand:
--   
--   <ul>
--   <li>With <a>StartEagerly</a>, the thread is started promptly. This is
--   appropriate for mini-protocols where the opening message may be sent
--   by this thread.</li>
--   <li>With <a>StartOnDemand</a>, the thread is not started until the
--   first data is received for this mini-protocol. This is appropriate for
--   mini-protocols where the opening message is sent by the remote
--   peer.</li>
--   </ul>
--   
--   The result is a STM action to block and wait on the protocol
--   completion. It is safe to call this completion action multiple times:
--   it will always return the same result once the protocol thread
--   completes. In case the Mux has stopped, either due to an exception or
--   because of a call to muxStop a `Left Error` will be returned from the
--   STM action.
--   
--   It is an error to start a new protocol thread while one is still
--   running, for the same <a>MiniProtocolNum</a> and
--   <a>MiniProtocolDirection</a>. This can easily be avoided by using the
--   STM completion action to wait for the previous one to finish.
--   
--   It is safe to ask to start a protocol thread before <a>run</a>. In
--   this case the protocol thread will not actually start until <a>run</a>
--   is called, irrespective of the <a>StartOnDemandOrEagerly</a> value.
